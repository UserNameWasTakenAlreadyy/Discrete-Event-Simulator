# Discrete-Event-Simulator
Discrete simulator project<br />
The main purpose of the project is to enforce good code design while also adhering the different principles in OOP. Over the semester, additional requirements will be introduced to ensure students have completed each part of the project using the OOP principles.<br />

Description:<br />
As the name suggests, this project simulates different types of cashiers (for example) a convenience store. The time of arrival of each customer as well as which cashier or server serves the customer is recorded. At the end of the text, the programme also prints out the number of customers served/left respectively. Through the semester, more complex objects are introduced into the problem. A customer could wait in line instead of just leaving. A server could go into rest while a self-checkout server would never need to rest. Different iterations of this assessment have different "extras" introduced. For example, a type of Priority Queue and Immutable List was provided for us to use here to further emphasise the idea of immutability.
